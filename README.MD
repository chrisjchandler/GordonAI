## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chrisjchandler/GordonAI.git

Note
Gunicorn is only compatible with UNIX-based environments. If you are deploying on a Windows server, you will need to use a different WSGI server that is compatible with Windows.


## Configuration

- You can adjust the `total_tokens` and other parameters in the `app.py` file to customize the behavior of the chatbot.

## Open AI Key
import your open AI key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your key name here"

You can get one from Openai.com

## Deployment

Use gunicorn instead of flask to allow for remote connections. 


gunicorn -w 4 -t 120 app:app
